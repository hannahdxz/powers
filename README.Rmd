# powers

The goal of powers is to perform basic computations on numerical vectors.

This package has four exported functions: `square()`, `cube()`, `box_cox()` and `my_log()`.
There is one internal function `pow()` which these four functions depend on.

## Example

In this section I will give some examples for each functions.

**(1)** `square(x,na.omit)`
This function squares a vector. 

`x` is the vector to be squared. 

`na.omit` is whether or not to remove NAs, the default is FALSE.
