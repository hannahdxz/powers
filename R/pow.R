#' Power a vector
#'
#' This is an internal function.
#'
#' @param x The vector to be powered.
#'
#' @param a The power.
#'
#' @return A vector that is the power a of \code{x}.
#'
#' @details
#' This function isn't complicated.
#'
#' And it almost certainly doesn't need two paragraphs in the "Details"
#' section!
#'
#' Here are some reasons why putting a list in this section is excessive:
#' \itemize{
#'      \item This \code{pow} function is quite simple.
#'      \item There's nothing else to say about \code{pow}.

pow <- function(x, a) x^a
